        Hello my name is Justice T. I am a sophomore
        at CSN and I will soon graduate with an Associates
        of Applied Science. My time here my have been brief,
        but I have enjoyed the classes here that will
        hopefully help get me a job.
        My favorite pass time is playing videogames and god is
        this the year where too many dope ones are coming out
        gonna be broke by 2020.
        i have two dogs little yorkie terriers who are really
        cute and give unconditional love.
        Other than that I'm just a guy trynna to find a purpose
        in this purposeless world, don't know where my journey
        will take me next but it can only get better from here.
